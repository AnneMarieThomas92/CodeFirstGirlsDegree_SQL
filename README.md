# Create a database
- I have created a database for a Doggy Day Care company. 
- In this database I have held information about the dogs and contact details for their ownsers.
- The dogs and owners are linked by their IDs in the ownership table. 
- I have also created a staff table for employees working at the doggy day care as well as records of their working days. 
- There is also a table about the days that the dogs were in the day care.
- This database would be used if someone was to set up a doggy day care buisness and wanted to keep track of dogs, owners, ownership and staff. 
- I have normalised the data by minimizing data duplication by created seperate tables for dogs, owners, ownership and visits. 
- I have used the queries to show how this data base could be used in real life scenerios.
